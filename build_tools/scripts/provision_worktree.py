"""Link into a git worktree the gitignored inputs it needs to produce a true answer.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A `git worktree` of this repo carries only tracked files. Everything a run actually
needs beyond that -- the per-machine `.env`, the venv, the LLVM toolchain, the derived fact caches, the
capsule answer keys and model weights, the hidden cohort -- is gitignored, and NOT ONE of them fails
loudly when absent. Each turns into a plausible-looking wrong answer: a corpus that reads as empty, a
capability that reads as undeclared, a module that skips rather than fails. Measured 2026-09-23:
standing up one runnable worktree took eight such artifacts, found one at a time over several hours,
and three wrong conclusions were drawn from trees missing one.

The roster is `build_tools/scripts/worktree_provisioning.yaml` -- data, reviewed, each entry carrying
the CONSEQUENCE of its absence, because the symptom is never "file not found".

    python build_tools/scripts/provision_worktree.py <worktree>           # link, then verify
    python build_tools/scripts/provision_worktree.py <worktree> --verify  # report only, change nothing
    python build_tools/scripts/provision_worktree.py <worktree> --from <checkout>

Links rather than copies: the artifacts are large and read-mostly, and a copy drifts from the source
silently -- which is the failure this script exists to prevent, one level up. An entry may ask for a
HARD link when its consumer refuses a symlink.

FAILS CLOSED. An artifact absent from the SOURCE is reported with its consequence and exits non-zero;
it is never skipped quietly. A roster that provisions nothing is an error, not a clean run. It also
reports which `merlin` the worktree's python imports, because the linked venv may name another
checkout's library.
