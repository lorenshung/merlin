"""Put a whole window of dataflow-connected groups to a package as ONE region capsule.

Exercises the real walk (`corpus_spec.build` per member, textual stitching at the seam,
`whole_program._spliced`'s role binding, the by-name coverage check) against a STUB package that
never runs a real compiler -- the same pattern `test_whole_program_buffer.py` uses for a single
group's ask (`_stub_package` / a fake ``invoke``).
