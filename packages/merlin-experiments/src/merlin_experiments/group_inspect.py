"""``merlin experiment inspect <candidate|package> --group gN [--stage S] [--trace]``: one group, rebuilt.

Debugging one group of a whole-model candidate used to mean a whole-model build and a hand search
through its work tree. This rebuilds THE GROUP ALONE through machinery that already exists, in a fresh
directory under the purgeable cache, and prints where everything is:

1. **The candidate.** A measured-mode job directory (``job.json`` names the target and the build
   options; ``package/`` is the snapshot that was measured), or a package directory with the same
   build options given explicitly (``--build-options FILE`` or ``--capsule``/``--machine``/...).
2. **The group's program.** :func:`merlin.perf.whole_model_group_timing.build_group_programs` with
   ``ask_only``: the package is asked for that group alone, every other group is stated by the
   reference, and the group becomes a one-step program of the target's own whole-model driver -- the
   interface the package was given, its command buffer and target artifact, the object, the program
   source and its ELF.
3. **Its IR at every stage.** The rebuild runs inside a compile trace that dumps every stage
   (:mod:`merlin.common.compile_trace`); a package whose compiler lowers through Merlin reports its
   stages from its own process. ``--stage S`` prints the IR of one stage, or one product.
4. **An instruction trace** (``--trace``): the group's program on the candidate's own functional
   model -- the ``spike`` machine its job declares -- with the simulator's execution and commit log,
   stopped after ``--run-to`` instructions. Every memory request the log commits is recorded, in
   order, as ``requested_addresses.json``; with ``--locality-granule`` its exact recurrence census
   (:func:`merlin.perf.address_locality.address_locality`) is taken at each granule, and
   ``merlin experiment census locality`` re-takes it at any other.
5. **Source-line attribution** (``--trace``): the program is linked a second time from the same
   inputs with debug information added, and that companion is admitted only if its allocated bytes and
   relocations are the program's (:func:`merlin.perf.debug_companion.verify_debug_companion`). The
   functional model's PC histogram of the program is then symbolized against the companion by the LLVM
   symbolizer of the target's own toolchain (beside the compiler its build recipe names) and attributed
   per function and source line (:func:`merlin.perf.debug_companion.attribute_symbolized_pcs`). Any step
   that cannot be taken leaves the attribution ``UNKNOWN``, with the reason.
6. **Timing and a counter profile** (``--time``, ``--profile``; :mod:`.group_probes`): the group's
   program on the elaborated-RTL emulator, graded exactly and tagged a ranking signal; and the group's
   hardware-counter facts and values (names from the target's counter header, values only from a
   trusted engine's console) with its instruction census by role.

Each step uses a hook the TARGET provides (its whole-model driver, a functional-model machine). A
target or candidate without one is told "not available for this target" and why; nothing is guessed,
and no target is named here.
