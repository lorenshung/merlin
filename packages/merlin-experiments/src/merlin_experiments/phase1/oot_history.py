"""The harness-owned compiler history of one phase-1 run: ``<run_dir>/oot``.

Every graded round commits the snapshot the grader is about to grade -- the operator-only copy, never
the live workspace -- and the official freeze tags ``frozen`` on the exact submission it hashed. Round
records then carry a commit sha instead of a copy of the package. Only this module writes the repo,
through :mod:`merlin.common.oot_repo`; the authoring agent never runs git here, and the repo is refused
when it overlaps the agent's writable workspace.

A run created before this history existed has no ``oot/``; it stays readable and records nothing,
rather than acquiring a history that starts mid-run. A commit that fails is RECORDED, never silent:
the round row says so and the freeze record carries the error, so a missing history cannot be
mistaken for a run that had nothing to commit.
