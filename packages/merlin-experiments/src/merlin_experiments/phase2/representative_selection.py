"""Conservative, unmeasured Phase 2 development-subset selection.

The unit is a whole performance family: predictive fit points, paired arms and
negative controls must never be separated by a shape-only set cover.  This is
an iteration-cost choice, not a performance, source-equivalence or coverage
certificate.  Omitted levers and connected source obligations remain visible.
