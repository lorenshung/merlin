The provisioned `native_supervisor` is the direct parent/reaper of every guardian.
`native_guardian` owns only its descendant tree. `chia_native` adapts public Chia
hooks; no worker-side Popen or private upstream tracker mutation is permitted.
`_protocol` owns bounded local packets, descriptor transfer and peer identity.
`owned_children` owns the shared kernel subreaper setup and direct/adopted child
pidfd termination and waitpid/ECHILD completion check. Both the existing native
guardian and the separately forked component feedback guardian use this primitive;
neither may replace actual closure with a /proc descendant snapshot. Callback
forking preserves live evaluator authorities and does not create native service
sessions or authorize delegated/non-descendant execution.

Require a private authenticated same-host/PID-namespace endpoint, explicit sessions,
worker and driver pidfds, and independent native-tree and guardian-reaping evidence.
Unknown cleanup is never success. Preserve native stdio/environment without exposing
session capabilities to candidates or receipts. Do not launch a background daemon on
import or automatically change an existing cluster. Service/host failure is not
qualified by worker-loss tests. Historical task receipts retain their old meaning.

The optional `container_transport` prepares an actual immutable static PID-1
command owner from packaged `container_guardian.c`. It uses only an explicitly
selected existing service and independently supplied image config/export byte
join; it never starts a daemon, pulls/imports/tags images, or grants the service
socket. `container_policy` converts the original closed tool-grant language;
image directory scopes are derived and hidden, with only original exact runtime
and input/output grants restored. Child output is encoded into a separate native
owner protocol. Cleanup completion requires that owner to observe `waitpid`
ending in `ECHILD`; service state/removal alone cannot supply it. A command can
cancel its owner, but cannot publish a completion receipt or access its output FD.
This diagnostic preparation is not fresh compiler origin, a target runtime role,
an authenticated model-client boundary, service failure authority, a native lease,
or an OS hard deadline. Partial-create cleanup may address only the invocation's
generated name/token/image identity. Reconstructed prepared handles refuse.

Frozen services and guardians use the existing frozen Python command builder and
snapshot seal. Their source reference comes from verified process-local bootstrap
state, never ambient environment or rehashed live checkout files. Session admission
and guardian READY must match that reference; frozen callers cannot silently downgrade.
The reference attributes service/guardian implementation, not an ordinary worker's
loaded imports or the candidate command. Production launchers remain separately wired.

`chia_group` owns driver reservations, task-reference association and independent
native lifecycle publication. It never changes the existing Chia task receipt's
meaning or upstream accounting. Its current locality policy is explicitly single-node:
only the driver's node may run managed work, with resource feasibility checked first.
Returned task results require matching native-start/exit evidence; bypass is not success.
Attempt every owned receipt despite an earlier failure, preserving primary exceptions.
