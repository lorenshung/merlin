"""Diagnostic evidence for the separate Phase 0 capture-execution boundary.

The model2MLIR receipt verifies materialized capture members. It does not prove
which source, checkpoint, Python dependencies, or ambient files the process read.
A diagnostic made after a run cannot upgrade that run to a sealed execution, even
if its bytes still match.

Exactly one issuer is admitted: Merlin's own sealed Model2MLIR CPU runner
(``capture_execution.sealed_m2m``, receipt schema ``merlin.sealed_m2m_cpu.v2``),
and only for a run that was PRESELECTED before it existed
(``phase0.capture_selection``) and then replayed in a fresh sandbox. Admitting
that runner is an operator policy decision: its receipt is unsigned and its
Python runtime closure is the copied venv rather than an independently pinned
dependency set; the decision accepts those residuals and records them in every
attestation it issues. Every admission re-reads the selection, the sealed
receipt, the model and the materialized receipt from disk and compares their
digests, so an edited attestation document cannot pass on its flags alone.
