"""Write one corpus member in a staging directory and move it into the corpus only when it succeeds.

A writer that fails part-way used to leave its half-written member in the corpus: a ``capsule.yaml``
and a ``golden.yaml`` that MANIFEST.yaml does not list, which the next ``rglob`` picks up as though
it had been built. Writing under a private staging root and renaming each finished member into place
makes a failed (or killed) write leave nothing at the member's corpus path.

The stage is a view of the corpus. Every member already written is linked into it, so a writer
that consults its siblings -- a qualified model reuses a per-group capsule another model already
wrote -- sees and reuses the real one exactly as before, and only directories it newly creates are
promoted. The member being written is not linked: a rerun into an existing corpus writes it afresh
and replaces the previous copy only once the new one is complete.
