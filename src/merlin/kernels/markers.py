"""Deterministic marker table: the heart of cheap, reproducible motif extraction.

A *marker* is a regex whose presence in a kernel's text is evidence that an optimization
*decision* was made. Markers are keyed by ``(isa_family, motif)`` rather than by producer:
because every source ultimately becomes C (XNNPACK ships C; Autocomp emits C; Exo is
compiled to C), the intrinsics that appear depend on the *target ISA*, not on who wrote it.
This means Autocomp-Gemmini C and Exo-Gemmini C share one marker set, and XNNPACK-RVV and a
hypothetical Exo-RVV share another.

We deliberately match *decisions* (a packed-weight pointer advance, an accumulator address
flag, a vector-length-agnostic loop) and never *constants* (tile sizes, LMUL values).

The table is DATA. Generic ISA-class files ship in core; target-specific patterns and
target spellings require an explicitly selected target-owned feature contract.

``markers_for(target)`` resolves a kernel's ``target`` to its family and returns the compiled
regex table for that family, merged over the ``generic`` baseline.
