"""Kernel-performance CEILING harness (S4.2) — compile a CURATED expert kernel
*standalone* and MEASURE its cycle count on **spike**, to establish the bar our
compiler's RVV codegen is judged against.

    attainment = ceiling_cycles / compiler_cycles

(1.0 == we matched the expert; < 1.0 == the expert kernel is faster than what we
emit; > 1.0 == we beat the expert). The ceiling is *measured*, never modeled.

Which corpus, and how it builds
-------------------------------
The ceiling is measured on a *standalone-benchmark* corpus (registry layout
``standalone_benchmarks`` in ``merlin/contract/corpora.yaml``): each benchmark ships its own
``main`` + golden data + an htif printf path, builds to a single ``.riscv`` ELF, and runs
under ``spike`` printing a cycle count per kernel invocation. No bare-metal main is
generated; the bench already is one. ``VOPACC`` benches are excluded per the mining
contract.

Everything specific to that corpus is DATA owned by the target the corpus registry names as
its owner: ``kernel_ceiling.yaml`` in the target's package (:class:`BenchConfig`), found
through the target registry. It carries the toolchain flags, the spike ISA/harts/memory map,
the bench tree layout, and which bench measures which op through which console reader. This
module holds only the generic build/run/read machinery, so a second corpus is a new config
file, not an edit here.

Honesty contract
----------------
:func:`run_kernel_ceiling` returns ``None`` (never a fabricated number) when the
toolchain/spike is unavailable, the bench won't build, the run fails, or the requested
``(M,N,K)`` is not among the sizes the bench actually executes. Each ceiling row records
exactly which bench/kernel produced it and how the cycle count was parsed.

Reading the console is deliberately three-valued (:class:`CycleReading`): PARSED, ABSENT (this
bench does not sweep that size), and UNPARSEABLE (it DID measure the size but the console did not
say so in a shape we recognize). The last is a tooling defect and is reported, never quietly
downgraded to "not measured" and never turned into a cycle count of 0.

The ``fingerprint_key`` ``(op, dtype, shape_regime)`` matches
:class:`merlin.kernels.compare.RvvFingerprint`'s key, so a ceiling row joins 1:1 to a
compiler-measured cycle count for the same op-shape.
