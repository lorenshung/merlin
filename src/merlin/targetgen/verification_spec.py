"""The agent-facing VERIFICATION SPEC — the answer-free acceptance contract, as a QA/verification team
would hand a compiler engineer bringing up brand-new hardware.

The experiment simulates early SW-stack bring-up: the agent's world is the RTL + a few helpers + maybe an
example kernel + docs, with NO pre-existing SW stack and NO precomputed answer key (the golden "would not
technically exist"). What the agent legitimately GETS is a spec of *what must hold to pass* — the target
operations, the datatypes/formats, the numeric acceptance policy, and the datapath-coverage requirement —
without any golden value or any detail of how the oracle computes the answer.

This module DERIVES that spec by aggregating the suite's per-capsule declarations (each ``capsule.yaml``'s
``operation`` / input+output dtypes / ``numeric_policy`` / ``expected.instruction_classes``) — the same
answer-free contract fields the agent already sees per capsule — into one coherent acceptance document. It
reads ONLY ``capsule.yaml`` (never ``golden.yaml`` / any answer surface), so the rendered spec cannot carry
an expected output. It is target-agnostic: everything comes from the ``TargetExperiment`` and its corpus —
no target-name literal, no regex.
