"""Does a capability's STANDALONE form survive an experiment's prohibited instruction roles?

A contract declares how a family runs standalone as evidence paths (``standalone_evidence``): the
derived hardware fact that licenses each path and the instruction roles a program uses to drive it
(:class:`merlin.targetgen.compute_units.EvidencePath`). A policy such as "no hardware loop
descriptors" (``prohibited_instruction_roles``) is a statement in the same closed role vocabulary, so
whether the capability survives it is a set intersection, decided per path:

* a path that needs a prohibited role is blocked;
* a path whose fact a supplied semantic-facts document does not report as derived is unproven;
* the capability is admitted standalone when at least one path is neither.

A capability declared only fused (``composed_with``) is never standalone, and one declared standalone
without any evidence (a declaration that predates this field) is admitted as declared and reported so.
Nothing here names a target, a fact or a role: all three are data.
