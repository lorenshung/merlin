"""A memory-order-perturbing variant of an elaborated-RTL simulator, and a seed sweep over it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every cheap engine this repo certifies on answers memory in ISSUE order. Spike has no
memory system; the chipyard RTL simulators (Verilator and GSIM alike) bind the SoC's AXI port to
testchipip's ``mm_magic_t``, which queues each read and returns it the next cycle, in the order it was
accepted, forever. A program that is correct only while two independent requests complete in the order
they were issued therefore passes every tier, and fails on a board whose memory controller does not keep
that order. Measured: a residual add whose overwriting accumulator load and accumulating load are not
ordered by completion passed L2 and L3 and then failed on FireSim with exactly the first operand's value
in the failing elements, differently from run to run.

WHAT IT CHANGES. Exactly one thing, and only when asked: ``mm_perturb_t``
(``merlin/contract/external/sim_memory/``) lets read and write responses with DIFFERENT AXI ids complete
out of order, each after a seeded random latency. Everything AXI4 guarantees is kept (same-id order,
contiguous bursts); read data is sampled at acceptance and writes land at their W beat, as in the stock
model. The model is chosen at run time by a plusarg -- without ``+mem_perturb_seed`` the variant builds
the stock ``mm_magic_t`` -- so the same binary gives the in-order answer and N reordered ones.

HOW IT IS BUILT, target-agnostically. Nothing here names a target, a design or a harness file. A
chipyard Verilator build leaves its objects and its makefile behind; the makefile's own dry run
(``make -n``) states the exact compile line of every harness source and the exact link line. The harness
source that constructs the memory model is FOUND by content (the one user source that builds an
``mm_magic_t``), patched structurally to build through ``mm_perturb_make`` instead, compiled with its own
recorded flags, and linked in place of the original object -- into a NEW directory. The source build is
never written to. A control relink of the UNMODIFIED objects is compared byte-for-byte to the declared
simulator, so the variant's receipt can say whether its only difference from the certified engine is the
memory model.

WHAT A VERDICT MEANS. ``sweep`` runs one ELF under the in-order model and under N seeds and reports
``order_sensitive`` when any seed's judged outcome differs from the in-order one's. That is a statement
about the PROGRAM under the ordering freedom the bus protocol grants; it is not a statement that any
particular chip will reorder those two requests. A clean sweep is evidence, not proof: N seeds sample
the schedule space, they do not cover it.
