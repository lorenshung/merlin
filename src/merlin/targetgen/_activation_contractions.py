"""Quantize the contractions ``quantize_`` cannot reach -- runs INSIDE the capture venv.

TorchAO's dynamic int8 schemes replace the weight of an ``nn.Linear``, and nothing else. A model's
other contractions keep their floating-point arithmetic under a program declared int8:

* a contraction of two ACTIVATIONS -- attention's ``Q @ K^T`` and ``P @ V`` -- has no module and no
  weight, so there is nothing for ``quantize_`` to replace. It reaches this module either as a
  ``matmul``/``bmm`` or inside a fused ``scaled_dot_product_attention``, which is spelled out here as
  its two matmuls around the masked softmax (the steps the capture decomposes it into anyway);
* a convolution is a contraction against a stored weight, but ``quantize_`` does not transform a
  ``Conv*`` module under these configurations.

On a datapath that consumes int8 on both operands those contractions cannot run at all, so a model
whose every Linear is int8 can still leave most of its multiply-accumulates on the host. This module
quantizes them in the SAME numeric form the scheme gives a Linear, so the program is uniform:

* the first operand is an activation, quantized dynamically, symmetric, one scale per ROW (per
  token) over the reduction axis, range ``[-127, 127]``, ``eps=1e-5`` -- TorchAO's own per-token
  input quantization for this config;
* the second operand takes the WEIGHT side of the scheme: symmetric, one scale per OUTPUT COLUMN
  over the reduction axis, the scheme's default int8 range and ``eps`` = float32 machine epsilon.
  For ``P @ V`` that is one scale per head-dimension channel of ``V``; for ``Q @ K^T`` one per key
  token. It is computed at run time because the operand is produced at run time; the form is the
  weight's, only the moment it is computed differs;
* the product is ``torch._int_mm`` -- int8 x int8 accumulating in int32 -- and is dequantized the
  way TorchAO's own Linear kernel dequantizes it: int32 -> float, times the row scale, times the
  column scale.

Both operands are quantized with TorchAO's own ``to_affine_quantized_intx``, so the scales and
rounding are the framework's, bit for bit, rather than a re-implementation that agrees with it.

WHAT IS LEFT ALONE, AND SAID. A contraction whose reduction extent is 16 or less stays in floating
point: TorchAO applies the same rule to a Linear ("int8 dynamic quantization only has benefit when
in_feature > 16"), and a rank-one outer product such as a rotary-frequency table is exactly the case
it protects. A convolution is quantized only where it is a pure re-layout of a matmul (stride equal
to the kernel, no padding, no dilation, one group -- a patch embedding); any other convolution is
left in floating point and counted. Nothing here names a target, a model, or a scheme; the numeric
form is the scheme's, and the decision to use it is the caller's.

Why a TorchFunctionMode and not a graph rewrite. The capture lowers the module by exporting it, and
the golden is the SAME module run eagerly; a rewrite of one of those two paths would let them drift.
Entering the mode inside ``forward`` puts both through the identical Python, and every decision is
made from shapes alone, which the export's fake tensors carry exactly.
