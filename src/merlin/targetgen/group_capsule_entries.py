"""Deterministic capsule entries for captured compute groups, and the one binding they are built under.

Restates compiler grouping decisions in the shared capsule vocabulary. No corpus
writes, golden generation, grading, promotion, or optional experiment imports.

Every consumer that turns ONE captured group into an interface capsule -- the derived model-form
and form-perf capsules, the capsule a whole-program build asks a package for, a grading harness --
goes through :func:`group_binding` and :func:`interface_capsule`. So the capsule that certifies a
group and the request a model build sends for that group are the same bytes under the same binding:
one grouping (``compute_groups`` + ``group_command``), one binding (``corpus_spec.derive_binding``).
Writing a capsule to disk (golden, scrub, instruction classes) belongs to the Phase 0 writer.
