#:   gated           its own gate deferred it (a whole-model capstone waiting on the op suite)
#:   screened_only   it cleared the cheap screen and the certify budget stopped before the gold tier
#:   budget_exhausted  it started and its wall-clock ceiling ran out before it finished
#:   cert_not_measured its elaborated-RTL tier was ATTEMPTED and produced no verdict (no completion
#:                     witness, no engine, or killed on the clock), so the cheaper tiers that did pass
#:                     are a screen and a screen may never certify -- see `tier_integrity`
#:

#: ``infrastructure_fault`` is here for the same reason as the rest and one more: it is not a
#: measurement of the submission, so counting it as a failure would attribute a harness bug to the

    THE CAPSULE ROUTE AND THE MODEL ROUTE ARE THE SAME JOB and used to be two implementations of it.
    `llvmlower.whole_program` put each compute group of a captured model to the package by writing
    the interface and calling ONE entrypoint, with no ``parse``, no ``lower_interface_to_target``, no
    contract validation of what came back and -- for every package that does not declare the optional
    bundle, which was all 76 in this tree when this was written -- no target artifact at all. So a
    group could splice a buffer the grader would have refused, and the whole-model artifact a
    performance arm reads was a file of placeholders. A capsule and a model group now reach a backend
    through this function, so the two cannot disagree about what "the package lowered it" means.

    ``invoke`` is the runner (default :func:`oot_runner.run_entrypoint`). An analysis worker runs a
    submission inside a host-created sandbox and must keep doing so; the SEQUENCE is not its business,
    so it injects the invocation rather than reimplementing the walk.

    Which commands produce the buffer and the artifact is
    :func:`oot_runner.analysis_emission_entrypoints` -- the package's own declaration, read once,
    here. It was a second inline feature-detection in the model route.

    ``overlap`` runs ``lower_interface_to_target`` and the buffer command at the same time: both read
    only the parsed interface and neither reads the other's output, so a caller with many groups to
    ask (a whole model) pays the slower of the two rather than their sum. The verdict is unchanged --
    the target plane is still judged first, and a failure there is reported as before.

    ``memo`` (a dict the caller owns for ONE package) records each accepted lowering by the interface's
    bytes: a whole model asks the same interface for many groups (SmolVLA: 27 distinct for 1,551), and
    re-reading the package's recorded replies -- up to 160 MB of target IR a reply -- for every one of
    them was most of a statement. A hit writes the same input and command buffer into ``generated`` and
    returns the recorded buffer (a copy) and artifact; a refusal is never recorded, so it is re-derived.
