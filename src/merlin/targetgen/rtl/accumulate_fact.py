"""``accumulate_on_load``: can a plain LOAD add into the accumulator, chosen per command by its address?

A two-operand sum needs no contraction if the accumulator can add an arriving row to what it holds.
Whether it can, and what decides it, is written in the elaborated design, and this reads it there --
never from a loop sequencer. Two structural readings, both of the target's own FIRRTL, plus the
instruction roles the target declares for the commands that reach them:

* the STORE: the accumulator memory's write data is the adder's sum when the write's accumulate bit
  is set, and the arriving data otherwise (``mux(<accumulate bit>, <adder sum>, <data>)``);
* the LOAD PATH: the accumulator bank's write accumulate bit is driven from the local address a load
  command carries (the address metadata's accumulate field, set by the program), and the module's
  load request delivers that field into the path.

The names (modules, signals, the select and sum fields) are the target's, declared in its
``semantic_probes.yaml`` under ``accumulate_on_load``; the library compares what it finds as data.
The roles are declared there too and checked against the closed role vocabulary and the target's
own instruction roles, so a policy that prohibits a role (a hardware-loop descriptor, say) can tell
whether this capability depends on one. A reading that fails is UNKNOWN with the reason.

The queues between the load request and the bank write (a reader, a scale unit, a pixel repeater)
are crossed by their declared field names, not traced through each submodule: the reading proves
the request field enters the path and the path's output drives the bank, and says so.
