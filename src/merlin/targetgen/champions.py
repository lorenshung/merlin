"""Export a phase champion from its OOT history into ``out/artifacts/targets/<target>/champions/``.

The champion is the tree the harness committed and measured, not whatever a workspace holds now:
the exported commit (a phase-2 run's ``best``, a phase-1 run's ``frozen``) is exported with ``git
archive`` semantics (:func:`merlin.common.oot_repo.export`) and its tree digest must equal the digest
the evidence was recorded against. The standalone layout is the one the publish bridge already
produces -- :func:`publish.assemble_repo_tree` preserves the payload bytes and
:func:`publish.embed_provenance` adds ``.merlin/{manifest.yaml,provenance.yaml,certification.yaml,
CHAMPION}`` -- so a champion directory is exactly what ``merlin-target-publish`` would push. This
module adds the four JSON records the payload-scoped publish layer cannot know:

* ``provenance.json`` -- lineage to the phase-1 run and its ``frozen`` commit (and, for a phase-2
  champion, the phase-2 run and ``best`` commit), the corpus seal digest and the phase-0 evidence digest;
* ``measurements.json`` -- what the champion was measured on;
* ``certification.json`` -- what certified it;
* ``isa_prohibition.json`` -- the whole-ELF prohibited-instruction scan, naming the instructions it
  prohibited (a clean verdict over an empty prohibited set is refused).

WHAT IS REQUIRED DEPENDS ON THE PHASE, AND THE PHASE IS DECLARED. Each phase selects its champion by
different evidence, so each has its own profile in :data:`PROFILES`:

* phase 2 (:data:`REQUIRED`) -- a whole-model program: FireSim cycles with the machine, the parameter
  header and a vendor control measured in the same batch, the exactness contract they were graded
  under, a passing whole-model GSIM certification and a clean whole-ELF scan;
* phase 1 (:data:`PHASE1_REQUIRED`) -- a compiler graded on capsules: the capsule certification at its
  tier (public and hidden results, the grader commit and the tier's engine, and how many of the passes
  were executed now against carried from an earlier grade, which must add up) and a clean whole-ELF
  scan that covered every capsule ELF the certification built. No whole-model number is asked of it.

The phase is the export call's ``phase`` or the provenance record's ``phase``; when both are given they
must agree, and an export that declares none is held to phase 2, the profile this exporter began with.
Nothing reads the phase off the target. Every field a profile lists is required and checked, never
defaulted: a champion whose cycles came without their machine, or whose scan was not clean, is refused
rather than exported with a gap a later reader would fill in by assumption. The export is
retention-pinned.

Three optional provenance blocks describe a lineage honestly where it does not fit that mould:

* ``lineage.legacy`` -- a lineage that predates the sealed phase 0 has no corpus seal and no phase-0
  evidence digest. The block (see :func:`legacy_problems`) may stand in for either digest, but only
  where the caller wrote the digest as an explicit ``null``; an absent digest is still refused, and
  the export prints ``UNSEALED LEGACY LINEAGE`` in ``.merlin/CHAMPION`` and ``MERLIN_PUBLICATION.md``.
* ``composition`` -- a champion composed from other packages rather than authored in one session says
  so (see :func:`composition`), and its base must lie in the exported history.
* a ``best`` from a history :func:`merlin.common.oot_repo.reconstruct` rebuilt from stored package
  bytes is recorded ``reconstructed: true``, and the reconstruction's ``frozen`` must be the declared one.
