"""Compare an authored software spec with the capability the target's own facts establish.

Phase 0 admits only what the hardware facts AND the authored spec both allow, so an authored field
narrower than the facts silently removes hardware capability from every later phase. The existing
audits look in one direction only: a claimed capability must have evidence. Nothing flagged a
capability the facts establish and the authored spec forbids. Measured on gemmini: the spec
hand-authored ``elementwise_map: placement fused_accelerator, composed_with [contraction]`` and
``quantization.eligible_operations: [contraction]`` while the facts establish a standalone operand
sum on the load path, so the standalone residual add was refused although nothing about the
hardware refused it.

This module compares the two field by field, in both directions, per operation family:

``ok``
    The authored field equals what the facts establish.
``restricted``
    The authored field is narrower, and a top-level ``restrictions`` entry names the family, the
    field, the values it declines and WHY. A software choice, reported but not blocking.
``forbids_established``
    The authored field is narrower with no recorded reason. BLOCKING: the authored spec forbids
    what the hardware facts establish.
``exceeds_facts``
    The authored field claims values the facts decide against. BLOCKING, as admission already is.
``unconfirmed``
    The authored field claims values a fact source that cannot decide that axis did not report.
    A review obligation, not a refusal (the capability ladder decides families, not every axis).
``undetermined``
    No fact source could decide the field at all.

Nothing here names a target, an opcode or an op spelling: the family vocabulary, the dtype
registry, the readout stage vocabulary and the quantization families are shared data.
