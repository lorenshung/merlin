"""The memory-order tier: does a certified program depend on memory answering in issue order?

WHY. The cert tier runs the elaborated RTL against a memory model that answers every request in the
order it was accepted. A program that writes the same accumulator rows with two loads and nothing
ordering their COMPLETION (only their issue) is correct on that model and wrong on a board whose memory
system reorders independent requests. Measured: an overwrite-then-accumulate residual add passed L2 and
L3, then on FireSim returned the first operand alone in the failing elements. A fence between the two
loads made it pass on the same board, and so did the vendor library's own residual add once fenced.

OPT-IN. The tier costs one in-order run plus N seeded runs of the memory-perturbing engine per capsule it
fires on, so it runs only when ``MERLIN_L3_ORDER_SEEDS`` names a positive seed count. Unset (or 0), a
grade is byte-identical to one from before this tier existed and no record is written.

WHAT IT DOES, both steps fail-closed:

1. A STATIC check over the decoded instruction trace (:func:`static_check`). Two inbound transfers whose
   destinations may overlap in the accumulator, with no barrier between them, are a hazard. A transfer
   whose direction or destination the decoder could not resolve, and a command whose memory effects
   this check does not model (a hardware loop unroller issues its own loads), count as UNRESOLVED.
   Unresolved triggers the sweep exactly as a proven hazard does: "we could not tell" is never "clear".
2. When the static check is not clear, the executable is re-run on the target's memory-perturbing RTL
   engine (:mod:`merlin.targetgen.mem_perturb`), in order and under N seeds, and every run is judged
   against the capsule's own golden. Any run that answers wrong under a legal schedule FAILS the
   certificate, and the record names the seeds that reproduce it.

WHERE THE FACTS COME FROM. The accumulator and accumulate bits of a local address come from the target's
derived ISA constants (:func:`merlin.targetgen.rocc.decode.isa_constants`, owned by the selected
backend) and the block width of a transfer from the derived array geometry
(:func:`merlin.perf.derived_bound.machine_from_facts`). Which commands move data, and in which direction,
is read from the decoded payload's own fields (the shared decoded-ABI field vocabulary of
:mod:`merlin.perf.deps.rocc`); which command is a barrier comes from the shared class-family table
(:mod:`merlin.targetgen.semantic_families`). A target without those facts is recorded as not applicable,
never checked against guessed ones.

WHAT A VERDICT MEANS. ``order_sensitive`` is a statement about the PROGRAM under the ordering freedom the
bus protocol grants, not a claim that a particular chip reorders those two requests. ``order_stable`` is
evidence, not proof: N seeds sample the schedule space, they do not cover it.
