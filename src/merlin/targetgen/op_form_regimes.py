    SMALLEST, NOT EXTREME, and this is a cost rule with a measured reason. A regime is entered the
    moment its boundary is crossed: a capsule whose working set exceeds the operand store by one row
    exercises the spill path exactly as one that exceeds it sixteen-fold, and costs a thousandth of the
    certification time. The corpus already carries the other kind -- five capsules consume 73% of all L3
    cycles, and the worst is a ``[16384, 16] x [16, 16384]`` reduction whose K is an order of magnitude
    past anything a real model contains and 32x the largest model-derived shape.

    So every regime is entered by the minimum margin the boundary allows, and the boundary is the
    hardware's own number. Where two axes can both be satisfied by growing different extents, the one
    that grows the MAC count least is chosen -- a deep K is cheaper to spill the operand store with than
    a tall M, because M multiplies against N and K does not.
