"""The per-compilation coverage certificate — the artifact that makes Acceleratable Region Recall
auditable.

For every region of a compiled workload it records BOTH sides of the ARR ratio:

- the **decision** the generated compiler actually made (``accelerator`` / ``in_contract`` /
  ``cpu_fallback``) — read from a :func:`merlin.targetgen.routing.route_plan` result (the *numerator*);
- the **eligibility** the hardware declares — from the independent oracle
  :func:`merlin.targetgen.eligibility.is_eligible` over the target's ``semantic_capabilities`` (the
  *denominator*).

The gap between the two is the compiler deficiency ARR is designed to surface: a region the hardware
*could* run (eligible) but the compiler left on the CPU lane (``false_fallback``), or — the integrity
direction — a region routed to the accelerator that the oracle says is *not* eligible
(``accelerated_ineligible``, an acceleration-precision miss).

This module consumes the routing output (numerator) and the eligibility oracle (denominator); it is NOT
the oracle, so it may legitimately reference both.

⚠️ BOTH SIDES OF THE RATIO ARE BUILT FROM THE ROUTING DEMANDS, so a contraction absent from those
demands is in neither. Earlier captures lost generic attention contractions this way; a generic op is
not, however, inherently unmatched. When the plan's contraction identities equal an independently
parsed inventory, ``denominator_completeness`` records that proof of inventory completeness and does
not charge the same generic work a second time. Without that check, the historical conservative
lower bound remains, and neither the upper recall nor its bound should be quoted alone.
