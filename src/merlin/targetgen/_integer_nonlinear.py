"""Integer-only softmax, GELU and layer norm -- runs INSIDE the capture venv.

A program whose contractions are all int8 (``_activation_contractions``) still computes its
nonlinear layers in floating point: every softmax evaluates ``exp`` and a division per element,
every GELU an ``erf``, every layer norm a reciprocal square root. On a core without a floating
point vector unit those are the bulk of the host's work, and they sit between two int8
contractions, so the program leaves the integer domain twice per layer only to come straight
back. This module replaces the three with the I-BERT integer algorithms (Kim et al., 2021),
evaluated per element in integer arithmetic only:

* **softmax** -- the row is put on a FIXED exponent grid ``S = ln2 / 2**K`` (the same grid
  ``merlin.llvmlower.passes_quant_int.lower_softmax_int`` uses, and for the same reason: the
  attention mask's sentinels must not set the grid), ``exp`` is the integer 2nd-order polynomial
  with a power-of-two range reduction, and the probabilities are returned as INT8 VALUES relative
  to the row's largest term, ``p = round(127 * e / e(0))``, normalized by their own integer sum.
  So the int8 operand of the next contraction (``P @ V``) is exactly ``p`` -- its dynamic row
  quantization is the identity on these values -- and the normalization is one per-row scale;
* **GELU** -- the input is quantized per row to int16, ``|x|`` rescaled onto a fixed grid by one
  dyadic multiply, and ``gelu(x) = relu(x) - |x| h(|x|)`` evaluated with ``h`` a degree-6 fixed-point
  polynomial (Horner's rule), dequantized by one per-row scale. Not I-BERT's 2nd-order i-GELU: its
  own 1.8e-2 error was measured to move a whole model past the float floor (see ``GELU_COEFFS``);
* **layer norm** -- the input is quantized per row to int16, the mean, the variance and the
  integer square root (Newton's method, a fixed number of iterations) are integer, and the
  normalization is one integer multiply and shift per element by a per-row factor. The affine
  weight and bias stay per-channel constants applied at the output.

What stays floating point, and said: the per-ROW scalars (a scale, its reciprocal), and the one
dequantizing multiply per element each function ends with -- the value the next int8 contraction
re-quantizes. No ``exp``, ``erf``, ``rsqrt`` or per-element division is left.

This is a DIFFERENT NUMERICAL MODEL from the floating-point one. A capsule captured under it is
graded bit-for-bit against its own reference (the same algorithm), and its accuracy against the
floating-point model is a separate, measured statement -- never assumed.

Nothing here names a target, a model or a scheme. The integer exp's constants are restated from
``passes_quant_int`` (this module runs where merlin is not importable) and a test holds the two equal,
so the two integer exps cannot drift apart; the GELU polynomial is re-derived by a test.
