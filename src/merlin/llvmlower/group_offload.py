"""The whole-model device route: one device call per CLOSED COMPUTE GROUP.

:mod:`.device_offload` moves a *contraction*. That is the right unit for a matrix instruction and the
wrong one for a whole model: a captured layer is a contraction plus the bias, the requantize, the
activation and the pooling its readout absorbs, and routing only the contraction leaves every one of
those on the host. The model then runs as a device call per matmul interleaved with host epilogues --
correct, and nothing like the program a hand-written whole-model schedule emits.

This module routes the unit the planner already forms. :func:`~..xdsl_dialects.lowering.compute_groups.form_groups`
closes a contraction together with the stages the target's readout takes;
:func:`~..xdsl_dialects.lowering.outline.outline_dispatches` already turns each such group into one
``func.func`` plus one ``func.call``; and
:func:`~..xdsl_dialects.lowering.group_command.program` already restates a group as the generator
entry a backend package builds from -- carrying ``epilogue``, ``acc_scale``, the convolution
geometry and the committed output type. All three existed. What did not was the step that puts them
in a line, so the call the outliner emits is answered by a kernel the target's own package emitted
from the group's REAL entry rather than from a bare ``M x K x N``.

**Every group is accounted for, by name.** A group is on the device, on the host, or refused with the
reason it could not be stated -- and :func:`census` reports the three counts separately so a mixed
program can never be read as one mechanism. :func:`require_every_group_accounted` is the raising
form: it is a defect for a group to be in none of the three, because that is what "silently dropped"
looks like from the outside.

Nothing here knows a target. The device is a parameter; the entries are derived from the module.
