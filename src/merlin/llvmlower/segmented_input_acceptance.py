"""Bind an explicit read-only consumer to a proved segmented tensor input.

The provider accepts the element address map and must not retain or write the
input. Dense owner storage comes from a separately supplied fresh writer
contract. The existing fresh-writer rewrite validates those contracts on a
clone before any source edits, and must subsequently run on the accepted route.
This helper emits no ABI bridge or device code and removes no view operations.
