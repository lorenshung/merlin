"""Which consecutive device groups of a captured model may be answered as ONE region kernel.

Today the whole-program statement (:mod:`.whole_program`) puts every device group to a package one
at a time: a package answers a matmul, or a residual add, and never both together, so it cannot fuse
a residual add onto the contraction that feeds it or keep an intermediate on the accelerator between
two groups. This module answers the one question that has to be answered BEFORE any of that is
offered: which runs of groups even COULD be one region, from the statement's own dataflow alone.

**The rule, and why it is the builder's to apply, not the package's.** A run of consecutive groups
``g_i, g_{i+1}, ..., g_j`` may be asked as one region exactly when every internal boundary in it is a
SINGLE-CONSUMER INTERMEDIATE THAT IS NOT A MODEL OUTPUT: group ``g_k``'s committed tensor (``k`` in
``(i, j]``... rather ``[i, j)``) is read by no group other than ``g_{k+1}``, and it is not the
model's own result. Both halves matter. A tensor two groups both read cannot be folded into one
kernel's private intermediate -- the OTHER reader still needs it as a named buffer. A tensor that IS
the model's result cannot disappear into a region either: something has to read it out, and the
statement already names the last device group's product as that result
(:func:`merlin.llvmlower.whole_program.whole_program_buffer`'s own convention, restated here rather
than re-derived, so the two cannot disagree about which group produces the output).

The rule is a fact about the model's dataflow, never about a name, a shape, an op spelling, or a
group count -- a two-layer synthetic model and a seventy-one-group capture are found by the same
walk, and adding a second target requires no change here at all.

**What legality does NOT decide.** A legal window is an OFFER, not a fusion: :mod:`.region_capsule`
still has to ask a package for it, the package may decline (or answer group by group, which reads as
declining), and a region that the package does not answer falls back to asking its members one at a
time -- exactly as an unaccepted single-group ask always has.
