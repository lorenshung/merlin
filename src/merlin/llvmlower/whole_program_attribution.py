#: program's without checking their shapes whenever the role counts happened to agree, so a group
#: could be counted as "the submission's" while its kernel read a wrongly-ordered buffer. Measured on
#: a captured ResNet-50 the moment the classification existed: of 123 bindings, 2 were identical and
#: 121 were permutations -- so the 35-of-71 split reported all session described bindings that were
#: not correct, and the honest answer to "how much of this model does the submission author" was
#: UNKNOWN, not 35. Any earlier figure is void rather than superseded.
