"""Put a WHOLE WINDOW of dataflow-connected groups to a package as ONE region capsule.

:mod:`.region_legality` says which runs of consecutive groups a package MAY be offered together; this
module is what makes the offer and reads the answer. It reuses exactly the pieces
:func:`merlin.llvmlower.whole_program._ask_package` already uses for one group -- the same
``corpus_spec.build`` per-op writers, the same ``capsule_common.lower_interface`` call, the same
``_spliced`` role-based binding -- so a region is not a second grammar: it is several of the SAME
single-op capsules, textually joined at the one seam each pair of neighbours shares, put to the
package in one call instead of several.

**The seam, and why nothing has to be renamed to make it.** Each member's own per-op capsule text
already reads its "activation" operand by whatever name its entry declares (``lhs`` for a
contraction, ``ifm`` for a convolution, either operand of a residual add). Before any text is
written, this module sets a NEIGHBOUR PAIR's shared boundary to one name: the producer's own ``out``
and the consumer's one operand that the whole-program statement already resolved to the producer's
tensor (found structurally, off the SAME generic-to-ABI rename `_as_declared` already performs --
never a second table of "which key names the activation for op X"). Two per-op bodies that agree on
one SSA name splice into one region exactly as :func:`corpus_spec.build_residual_seam` already writes
a contraction and a residual add by hand, except the members here are found, not authored.

**A region is FUSED: one kernel, graded at its boundary.** The package answers the whole window with
ONE kernel that reads the window's external operands and commits the BOUNDARY member's tensor (the
last member's -- the only one anything outside the window reads, which is what made the window legal).
Every internal member's tensor is the kernel's own business: the package may stage it in the program
buffer it is bound to, keep it on the accelerator, or never form it at all -- how is the package's to
decide, and nothing here prefers one way. What the region computes is judged at its boundary, against
the oracle, as one claim
(:func:`merlin.perf.whole_model_build.bind_groups` links it as one call; the target driver restates
each internal member from the inputs the device held and grades the boundary from them).

**Coverage is earned at the boundary, not by opcode.** A reply is accepted for the window only when
the boundary's own program tensor is committed BY NAME after splicing; an internal member's output is
bound to its program buffer when the reply declares it and is never required. There is deliberately no
check that each member's opcode appears among the commands: a fused kernel need not spell a member as
its own command, and a kernel that silently skipped one computes a wrong boundary, which the region's
correctness check catches -- a by-opcode check would refuse honest fusion and pass nothing a wrong
answer could not also pass.
