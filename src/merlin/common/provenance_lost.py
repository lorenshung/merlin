"""Bytes a body of results is attributed to, which no longer exist and cannot be reproduced.

A separate module from :mod:`merlin.common.provenance` because it answers a different question. That
one asks "is this checkout the declared revision" and expects an answer either way. This one is for the
case where there is no answer to be had and there never will be again, and the design follows from
refusing to let that case borrow either of the ordinary answers.

THE MEASURED CASE. A pinned simulator-compiler binary was rebuilt in place, and by the time anyone
noticed, 244 artifacts recorded the old digest as the tool that produced them. Three things can be done
with that, and two are worse than the loss:

* repoint the declaration at the bytes now on disk -- every one of those artifacts keeps asserting a
  digest nothing on the host has, while the registry says the pin is fine. The attribution is then not
  broken, it is silently WRONG, which is the failure the pin registry exists to prevent;
* delete the declaration -- the citations dangle with no account of what they point at;
* record the loss: what was lost, when, why it cannot be rebuilt, and what DOES still verify.

A loss record CLAIMS its digest: the pin and artifact loaders are cross-checked against it, so nothing in
the registry can re-declare those bytes as its own. And :func:`lost_for_digest` makes a citation
resolvable -- the artifacts citing lost bytes never re-hash them, so they do not fail and never will, and
asking is the only way anyone finds out.
