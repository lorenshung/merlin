"""When is a model CLOSED -- that is, when is "its compute groups" the whole program?

One definition, in one place, because two spellings of this would drift and the second one would
silently accept a different set of models. The rule:

    A model is closed when its only host region is the quantization of a model ARGUMENT onto the
    integer grid.

That one region is the exception, and it is an exception on purpose rather than an oversight in the
command vocabulary. The caller hands the model a float image; something has to put it on the grid,
and that conversion is the program's INPUT DOMAIN rather than a step of it -- a device program
legitimately begins with its operands already quantized. Any OTHER host region computes BETWEEN the
groups, and then a program built from the groups is not the model: it would run a third of the layers
and report a number under the model's name.

Used by the group-model harness (which builds a bare-metal program of exactly these groups) and by
:mod:`merlin.llvmlower.whole_program` (which states them as one command buffer). Both refuse on the
same predicate, so "closed" means the same thing in a measured cycle count and in an emitted buffer.

    Both halves are load-bearing. ``stages == [QUANTIZE]`` means the region does nothing but the

    quantize's source being a BLOCK ARGUMENT means it converts something the caller handed in, not an
    intermediate: a requantize in the middle of a model is the same operation on a value the model
    itself produced, and leaving that on the host is exactly the split this predicate exists to catch.
