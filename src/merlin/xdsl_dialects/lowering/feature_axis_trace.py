"""Where a rank-N activation keeps its features, DERIVED from the contractions its data flows through.

:func:`merlin.xdsl_dialects.lowering.group_demand.feature_axis` first reads the answer off the
framework operators a capture records (a convolution's published signature fixes its activation's
axis order). A capture whose convolutions were rewritten before export -- as an im2col of slices,
transposes and reshapes feeding an integer ``matmul`` -- records no such operator, and then nothing
it TAGS says where a rank-4 activation's features are. Its DATAFLOW still does, and this module reads
it there:

* a contraction's REDUCTION extent, on the operand that is not the stored one, is that activation's
  input features -- an im2col packs each window's channels into it, with the window's taps;
* a contraction's OUTPUT column -- the extent the stored operand contributes and the activation does
  not -- is its output features, which the program's reshape and transpose then put back into a
  rank-4 tensor.

So the query tensor's axes are followed, as row-major FACTORS, through every op that only moves or
relabels data (transposes, reshapes, slices, pads, concatenations, and elementwise ops whose maps are
permutations) to the contractions it reaches in either direction. At each one the feature axis is the
query axis whose whole non-unit extent lands in the feature extent and nowhere else: a window's taps
split the image's spatial axes between the positions and the reduction, so only the channel axis lands
wholly in the reduction; the positions of an output gather every spatial axis, so only its channel
axis lands wholly in the column.

FAIL CLOSED, NEVER GUESS. A step this module cannot follow exactly (a broadcast, a reduction, a
reshape whose factors do not align, a slice that drops an axis) ends that path with no answer. A
contraction where no axis -- or more than one -- lands wholly in the feature extent is AMBIGUOUS and
answers nothing. Two paths that answer differently are a DISAGREEMENT and the caller refuses. Nothing
here names a target, an operator spelling from a framework, or a layout.
