"""A bare integer sum over a trailing window, recognized as a window mean of multiplier one.

An integer-arithmetic model (an I-BERT style layer norm, say) sums a row it has already quantized to a
narrow integer and keeps the raw accumulator: ``quantize -> narrowing cast -> linalg.reduce(addi)``, no
dequantize, never leaving the integer domain. That is a contraction a unit performs -- the row against
a column of ones -- with no readout scale at all, so it is stated as :attr:`Group.window_mean` with
``multiplier`` fixed at ``1.0`` and every consumer of a window mean reads it unchanged. Split out of
:mod:`.compute_groups` (which calls it while it forms host regions) to keep that module under the size
gate. Nothing here names a target.

    The shape is exactly ``quantize -> narrowing cast -> linalg.reduce(addi)``, in that order (the
    quantize in this region or the one before it, since formation closes a region at a quantize): a real
    quantize marker states the row is a narrow integer at capture time, and ITS RESULT carries that
    dtype -- the reduce's own operand is already widened, so reading the dtype there would ask a unit
    about the accumulator's format instead of the operand's. A mask population count (a cast with no
    quantize) is not this form; neither is a floor-based softmax denominator.
