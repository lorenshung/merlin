"""What a compute group DEMANDS of a backend, in the words a capsule corpus is built from.

Group formation (:mod:`.compute_groups`) decides which operations run together on which unit. This
states one of those groups as an entry a backend can be asked for: the operation, its extents, and
the epilogue in the command-buffer's own stage names. A model route and a capsule route lower the
same pattern only if they are asked in the same words, so the capsule that CERTIFIES a pattern and
the model that NEEDS it are built from this one statement and cannot drift apart.

A group the vocabulary cannot state raises :class:`NoCapsuleForm` with the reason, and
:func:`.compute_group_demand.demand` counts those rather than dropping them: a model must not read as
fully demanded because the part nobody could state was quietly skipped. Nothing here names a target.

#: 256-channel 56x56 plane under one reading and a 56-channel 256x56 plane under another, and the
#: two differ by a permutation that no reshape performs. The capture states which it is, not
#: through a layout attribute -- it carries none -- but through the ATen operators it was exported
#: from. Each key below is an operator whose PUBLISHED SIGNATURE fixes the axis order of an
#: activation operand, mapped from that operand's RANK to where the features sit in it:
#: ``aten.conv2d`` takes ``(N, Cin, H, W)`` so a rank-4 activation has features at axis 1, while
#: ``aten.bmm`` takes ``(B, n, m)`` so a rank-3 one has them last. The rank matters because the
#: same capture can carry both, and an operator says nothing about a rank its signature does not
#: mention. These are the frameworks' contracts, readable in their own documentation, and they say
#: nothing about any target.

    attribute. Only operators that speak about THIS rank are consulted -- a convolution says
    nothing about a rank-3 activation -- and operators indifferent to the order (an elementwise
