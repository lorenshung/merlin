"""Verify a target's DERIVED extent lattice — the same one the capsule corpus is built from.

The review comment this answers is *"the capsules are very case-specific"*. They are: the dynamic
ladder grades the shapes it can afford, tens of them, each on one stimulus. This attempts to sweep
the lattice the target's own RTL facts define. A successfully verified point proves that the
compiled program computes the declared contraction **for every input** at that shape.

The lattice is not invented here. A reviewed conformance requirement is generated
from the target's capability manifest and RTL facts and already carries both halves:

* ``cells`` — the conformance cells (family x dtype x alignment) the target must handle;
* ``boundaries.extent_probes[].points`` — extents that straddle each real hardware boundary: the
  degenerate 1, a mostly-empty tile (edge/4), edge/2, the tail (edge-1), the exact tile, the overflow
  (edge+1), and two tiles.

Those points were dead code before this module: ``corpus_synth.extents_for`` reads only the ``edge``.

**Cost is on our side here.** Sweeping a lattice means verifying CORRECT programs, which is the cheap
``unsat`` direction — a correct program's two sides are syntactically identical and z3's rewriter
collapses the query before bit-blasting anything. The expensive ``sat`` direction only applies when a
pass is actually broken, and then the smallest failing shape is the one you want anyway.
