"""Will the target's readout actually APPLY the epilogue this program declares?

THE DEFECT, MEASURED. A capsule declared ``COMMIT output_dtype='i32' epilogue=['relu']`` and its
device output came back with 126 of 256 values negative, ``min = -85`` -- exactly the raw accumulator.
The compiler's intent was right (the command-buffer numeric floor and trace both passed); the
hardware simply discarded the activation, because on that target the full-width readout writes the
accumulator unmodified while only the narrowing readout applies scale and activation. The grade's own
diagnosis named the shape of the cause without knowing it: *"some field the command buffer cannot
carry (a config scale, an accumulate/dataflow bit, a readout dtype)"*.

It went unnoticed for the worst possible reason: the sibling capsule with the SAME declared epilogue
passes, because the default stimulus is non-negative, so the accumulator is never negative and
``max(0, x)`` is the identity on every value that program can produce. A declared-but-discarded
activation is invisible unless the data can tell.

WHY THIS IS NOT A FACT ABOUT ONE TARGET. Every accelerator with more than one readout width has this
shape: a readout that requantizes applies the epilogue, a readout that dumps the accumulator does
not, and which is which is a property of that datapath. So the RULE is stated here and the
CAPABILITY is supplied by the caller from the target's own declaration -- exactly as
``counter_engine_kinds`` and the row pitch are. Nothing in this module names a target, a dtype width
or an opcode, and a readout the target does not describe is UNKNOWN rather than assumed applicable:
assuming would reproduce the silent-discard defect on the next target instead of catching it.

WHAT A CALLER DOES WITH THE VERDICT. :data:`REFUSING_STATUSES` mirrors
:mod:`merlin.perf.lowering_obligation` so a caller decides whether a status is fatal for its tier. A
``discarded`` verdict means the emitted program computes something other than what it declares, which
is a correctness defect and not a performance one -- but flipping a long-passing capsule to failing
is a corpus decision, so this module reports and the caller chooses.
