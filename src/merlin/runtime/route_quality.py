"""The QUALITY of a route claim, checked on a produced command buffer.

WHAT THIS ADDS TO ``route_partition``
-------------------------------------
:mod:`merlin.runtime.route_partition` closes the partition: every region lands in ``A`` (accepted),
``H`` (an explicit host or composed route) or ``D`` (an explicit decline), and a buffer that lands
nowhere is a violation. That is a check on the SHAPE of the claim. Nothing checked the claim itself,
and the two ways a conformant buffer can still be wrong are exactly the two this module names.

**Tier 1 — the declaration gap.** A region routed ``H`` states a reason. Nothing required the reason
to be TRUE. Measured on a deployable ResNet-50 package (``lane_placement``, 173 rows): 119 regions
are placed on a scalar host lane, each carrying a reason of the form *"family 'quantize' has no
datapath on a 16x16 i8 systolic mesh"*. With the target's facts extracted, 116 of those 119 refusals
are contradicted by the target's OWN derived capability — the derived epilogue capability licenses
``relu``, the declared readout census applies ``acc_scale`` and ``maxpool``, and the facet's
``operand_sum`` licenses the integer sum of two separately scaled tensors that a residual add is.
Three come back ``UNKNOWN``. A declaration gap was shipped as a hardware limit, and every downstream
reader (a planner, a cost model, a person deciding whether the accelerator earns its area) believed
it.

The oracle is never a literal here. It is the readout facet derived from the target's own RTL facts
and backend hooks (:mod:`merlin.targetgen.readout_facet`), and which derived field adjudicates which
op family is DATA, declared in ``mlir_oot_backend_contract.yaml`` under
``admission.route_quality.host_refusal_evidence``. A family the contract does not name, or a field
the facet could not derive, comes back ``UNKNOWN`` with the reason — never a pass, and never a
confirmation. A refusal is CONFIRMED only when the deciding rung produced a positive derivation that
excludes the work; "we could not tell" and "the target refuses" are different verdicts and this
module keeps them apart.

**Tier 2 — host compute inside an accepted region.** Tier 1 only catches a package that SAYS it
moved work to the host. A package can route a region ``A``, emit target commands for it, and still
run arithmetic on the host inside the same region while saying nothing at all. Tier 1 cannot see
that: the buffer's placement record is clean.

This tier is checkable WITHOUT knowing the target's dialect, because the host ISA is always known —
a RISC-V scalar core plus declared standard extensions — and the host IR is in the package. The
discriminator is **data dependence, not opcode family**. Address arithmetic is
``integer_arithmetic`` too: a rule that counted arithmetic by family would veto every legal
descriptor setup, and an unsatisfiable rule is one everybody routes around. So an arithmetic
operation is a finding only when its operand chain reaches a LOAD FROM A TENSOR BUFFER — a
``kernel_abi`` argument, a module-level buffer, or a stack slot some tensor-reaching value was
stored into. Arithmetic that reaches only induction variables, constants and pointer roots is
addressing, and addressing is fine.

Work found in an ``H`` region is COVERAGE, not a defect: an ``H`` region is where host work is
supposed to be, and counting it is how a reader sees that the instrument is looking at the right
program. Absent or unparseable host IR is ``incomplete`` with a stated cause, never ``ok``.

PHASED, BOTH TIERS
------------------
Each tier is a gate with a phase declared in ``merlin/contract/gate_phases.yaml`` and read through
:func:`merlin.perf.gate_phase.configured_phase`. ``incomplete`` is a STATUS, orthogonal to phase,
and never a pass at either.

TARGET-AGNOSTIC
---------------
No target name, opcode, lane spelling or stage vocabulary is written here. Which regions went to a
host lane comes from the buffer's own ``params.host_lane_regions`` / ``params.mesh_regions``; the
accepted/host split of a task comes from the program plan's own ``kind``; epilogue stage names are
the command-buffer ABI's; the capability comes from the target's derived facet; and the
family-to-evidence map is contract data.

**Measured on that same package**, tier 2 reports 20 of 54 accepted tasks running host arithmetic on
tensor data — 4,936 operations — beside 37,865 operations of addressing in the same tasks that it
correctly clears. That ratio is the point: a family-count rule would have vetoed all 42,801.
