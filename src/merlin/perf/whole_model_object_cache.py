"""The whole-model build's per-group compiled-object cache.

Compiling a package-answered group's LLVM artifact to a riscv object is the expensive step of a
whole-model build: a full rebuild recompiles every answered group even when an edit changed one
group's kernel. This module lets :mod:`merlin.perf.whole_model_build` reuse a PRIOR object for a
group whose artifact text is byte-identical to one already compiled, under the same target and
toolchain, instead of recompiling it::

    root = object_cache_root()
    fingerprint = object_cache_fingerprint(target)  # everything besides the artifact text and the
    # target name that decides the compiled bytes
    key = object_cache_key(artifact_text, target=target, fingerprint=fingerprint)
    cached = root / key[:2] / f"{key}.o"  # present -> reuse; absent -> compile, then store

A reused object must be byte-identical to what a fresh build would have produced for the same
inputs, so the fingerprint has to cover everything that decides those bytes -- see
:func:`object_cache_fingerprint`. A lookup that cannot be verified (an unreadable toolchain binary, a
target whose recipe declares no stack-frame policy) disables the cache for that build rather than
guessing: fail closed to a fresh compile, never to a cache entry nobody can vouch for.

    Hashing a hand-picked file or two is exactly the "too-narrow pattern silently drops valid input"
    failure this repo's own regex rule warns about, applied to a cache instead of a parser: a file the
    picker forgot would keep serving stale bytes forever with nothing to notice. So this hashes every
    ``.py`` file the lowering path can reach (:mod:`merlin.llvmlower`, whole package) plus the two
    modules outside it that also decide the outcome (:mod:`merlin.targetgen.contract.compile`, which
    calls the stack-frame preflight, and :mod:`merlin.targetgen.contract.stack_usage`, which measures
    it) -- sorted by path so the digest does not depend on filesystem enumeration order.

    Two RESOLVED FACTS also decide the bytes and are read directly rather than hoped to be implied by
    a source hash, because they can come from data (a target's registry/manifest), not code: the
    target's ``-march=`` (a different ISA string recompiles identically-shaped IR to different
    instructions) and its stack-frame policy's ``max_static_bytes`` -- a budget that merely tightens,
    with no source file touched, can turn on the arena-rewrite repair path
    (:func:`merlin.targetgen.contract.compile._repair_oversized_frame`) and change the emitted bytes
    for the identical input.

    The toolchain binaries actually invoked (``clang``, ``mlir-translate``, the m2m venv's python) are
    hashed by CONTENT, not path/size/mtime, so an in-place binary replacement of the same size cannot
    be missed. NOT covered: an upgrade inside the m2m venv's installed packages (e.g. a torch-mlir
    version bump) that replaces no file this repo owns and no binary path here -- the reference-context
    cache (:func:`merlin.perf.whole_model_group_timing._reference_code_digest`) accepts the identical
    scope limit for the identical reason: chasing every transitive dependency of an out-of-process
    interpreter is unbounded, so this hashes the interpreter binary itself and the facts and code this
    repo controls, and documents the gap rather than hiding it.
