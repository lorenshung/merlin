"""Decide a move-in placement family from the candidate's OWN emitted traces, PER REGIME.

The third ``EMITS`` family, and the first whose demand is not made of every member. That is not a
softening: it is the measured fact that shapes it. On pinned elaborated RTL, moving the staging off
the front of the nest and into it measured -22.3% and -12.7% on two shapes and -3.2% and -0.6% on two
others. The two it paid on are LOAD-critical and the two it did nothing on are MESH-critical, and on
a mesh-critical shape the order that keeps the array's operand resident stages a whole run of moving
windows together -- so a demand for just-in-time placement there would FIGHT the demand that actually
pays (:mod:`merlin.perf.stationary_claim`). A corpus that asked for it everywhere would be asking a
compiler to be slower on two thirds of its work.

So this family sorts its members into three buckets and demands the property of one of them:

* ``lever_bearing`` -- a load-critical member with more than one compute position. Hoisting is
  expressible and just-in-time placement is distinguishable from it, so the property is refutable.
* ``control`` -- a single-position member. The whole movement set IS what the first compute reads, so
  the exposed prefix is compulsory and ANY correct program passes. This is what makes a
  lever-bearing failure attributable to the placement rather than to something broader.
* ``exempt`` -- a mesh-critical member. The demand is WAIVED and the waiver is recorded.

THE EXEMPT BUCKET IS REQUIRED, not merely tolerated, and that is the honest part. A family that
demanded the property everywhere and a family that conditioned it on the regime are the same family
until a member actually falls in the exempt bucket. Requiring one makes the conditioning visible in
every report, and makes deleting it a test failure rather than a silent strengthening.

THE REGIME BOUNDARY IS NOT GUESSED, AND IT IS NOT NEEDED. The discriminant is the reload multiplicity
(see :func:`merlin.perf.schedule_proxy._regime`), and the four measured points bound the boundary to
the open interval (4, 7] and no further -- one of them carries a ~7% per-arm noise floor. Rather than
pick a number inside that interval, this classifies only OUTSIDE it: at or below the lower edge a
member is load-critical under every boundary the evidence admits, at or above the upper edge it is
mesh-critical under every one, and a member landing strictly between is UNCLASSIFIABLE and refuses
the cohort. The two edges are read from the family's own frozen acceptance -- data, reviewed with the
declaration -- never from a literal here, and a contract declaring neither gets a refusal.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS NOT A BOUND. It decides only which bucket a member lands in; the pass/fail
arithmetic comes entirely from the trace. A mis-classification can weaken the discrimination report,
which is visible, but it cannot manufacture a failure.
