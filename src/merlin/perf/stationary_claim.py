"""Decide a stationary-operand residency family from the candidate's OWN emitted traces.

This is the second ``EMITS`` family in the corpus and it follows
:mod:`merlin.perf.load_state_claim` deliberately: the evidence is the candidate's own instruction
stream, the property is :func:`merlin.perf.stationary_residency.residency_verdict`'s, and the verdict
is about the COMPILER rather than about the machine. What it adds is a second bucket rule and a
second refusal, both of which exist because this lever's floor is conditional in a way the load
path's was not.

THE COHORT MUST BE ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE, and that is CHECKED rather than declared:

* a member whose declared output extent spans MORE THAN ONE array row block is LEVER-BEARING: the
  nest has positions that differ only in the accumulator tile and the moving operand's window, so a
  compiler naming the block at each of them re-shifts identical bytes, and the property is refutable;
* a member whose output extent fits one row block is a CONTROL: every position presents a different
  block, the floor equals the count at either floor kind, and ANY correct program passes it.

The control is not a member on which nothing can fail -- it would fail a program that named a block
twice for one position. What it IS, exactly, is the member that the DEFECT THIS FAMILY NAMES passes,
which is what makes a lever-bearing failure attributable to the reuse depth rather than to something
broader. If a control fails, the cohort is REFUSED rather than scored.

THE SECOND REFUSAL, and why it is not optional. The property has two floors (see
:mod:`merlin.perf.stationary_residency`): a run-length floor that needs no reordering, and a
distinct-tile floor that a loop order cannot dodge but that only applies where the target's
accumulator admits the reuse-ordered nest. A lever-bearing member decided at the WEAKER floor was not
asked the question it was minted to ask -- a compiler can pass it by scattering each block's
positions -- so such a member is reported UNDECIDED, not passed. Reading a weak-floor pass as a pass
is precisely how a demand that cannot fail gets shipped, and here it would have been invisible
because the verdict still says PASS.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS NOT A BOUND. Which members are lever-bearing is read from the declared output
extent against the target's own array row count. It decides only which bucket a member lands in; the
pass/fail arithmetic comes entirely from the trace. So a mis-classification can weaken the cohort's
discrimination report -- which is visible -- but it can never manufacture a failure.
