"""An open model's oracle, recomputed in a process of its own or read back from its content-keyed cache.

The oracle (:func:`merlin.perf.whole_model_open.oracle`: the model evaluated in numpy, every device
dispatch's operands and result digested) depends on the model and the target, never on the package
under test, so it starts with the build and is joined only where the build first needs it. For a
transformer it is minutes of interpreter-bound work that used to run after the device part, on the
build's critical path; recorded by the digest of everything it is a function of, a later build of the
same model (another candidate, a rebuild) reads it back.

The child recomputes which groups are device dispatches exactly as the build's cut does (the normalized
module's non-host groups, joined to the capture's groups by region), and the build refuses a result
whose dispatch set is not its own. Nothing here names a target.
