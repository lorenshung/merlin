"""Did the emitted stream KEEP its load configurations, or re-establish them per block?

THE LEVER. A target whose load path holds several configurations live lets a program configure each
operand's movement once and then address it by a selector carried in the configuration command. A
program that does not use the selector has one slot, and a contraction moves two operands whose row
pitches differ (the activation's pitch is its reduction extent, the weight's is its output extent),
so the one slot alternates and never holds what the next transfer needs: the configuration command is
re-issued on every block of the nest. Nothing in this corpus asked for it. The measured consequence
of nobody asking is the whole reason this module exists -- a correct compiler that re-configures the
load path on every ``(m, n, k)`` block is exactly as correct as one that does not, and the numeric
oracle cannot tell them apart.

THE PROPERTY, and why it is decidable from the candidate's OWN trace with no second arm:

    A configuration command carries no address. Two such commands with identical payloads therefore
    configure identical state, and the second one cannot be made to matter by any machine state the
    first did not already establish -- which is precisely the argument
    :func:`merlin.targetgen.trace_check._stale_mode_config_findings` already makes for the execution
    mode, applied to the load path. So a load configuration that re-establishes what a state already
    holds is PROVABLY inert work, not a proxy for it.

    Hence the demand: **the number of load-configuration commands must not exceed the number of
    DISTINCT load configurations the program uses, whenever that number is within the target's
    derived load-state capacity.** Stated over the property, never over a mechanism -- a schedule
    that avoids the reissue by staging both operands under one configuration satisfies it just as a
    schedule that uses two selectors does, and neither is named here.

WHY A STRUCTURAL PASS CRITERION AND NOT A CYCLE BOUND.

1. The quantity is exact. Every excess command is one dispatched instruction that establishes state
   already held; there is no modelling step between the observation and the claim, so no cost model
   can be wrong about it.
2. A cycle bound needs a second arm, and the second arm for this lever is a different compiler --
   not a different shape or a different emitter knob. A paired cycle delta between two emitter
   settings would measure the machine; it would not require the candidate to do anything.
3. It cannot be satisfied by being slow but correct, which is the failure mode that makes a
   performance demand harder than a correctness one.

WHAT PASSING DOES NOT PROVE, said plainly because the alternative is the failure this repo keeps
repeating: passing shows that the redundant configuration work is ABSENT. It is not a speedup claim
and it does not certify that the movement schedule is good. A family that quoted it as a win would be
overclaiming.

FAIL CLOSED EVERYWHERE. The selector's position and width come from the target's own extracted
register-bundle layout; the capacity comes from that width. A target that publishes no such layout,
or a trace whose configuration operands do not resolve to constants, yields ``REFUSED`` with the
reason -- never a pass, and never a substituted default.
