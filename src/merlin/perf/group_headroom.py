"""Per-group HEADROOM: measured cycles against the same-machine reference, and two DERIVED bounds --
never a suggested fix, only where a group sits relative to what the target's own facts say is
achievable.

Two bounds, both roofline-simple by design (this is a per-group DIAGNOSTIC, not the tiling-search
achievable bound :mod:`merlin.perf.derived_bound` computes for a whole workload search):

* **compute bound** -- ``macs / mesh_macs_per_cycle``, where the mesh's rate is the array geometry
  :func:`merlin.perf.derived_bound.machine_from_facts` already derives from the target's own RTL
  facts (never a nameplate, never a literal here).
* **data-movement bound** -- ``moved_bytes / dram_bytes_per_cycle``, the same machine's own derived
  DMA rate. ``moved_bytes`` is the group's OWN tensors (image, weight, result) -- never the im2col
  matrix a convolution's unit never materializes, which would over-charge a k>1 tap ninefold (see
  :class:`merlin.perf.schedule_proxy.Contraction`'s own note on the same trap).

Every rate is read off :class:`merlin.perf.derived_bound.Machine`; a term whose fact is UNKNOWN drops
out rather than being defaulted, and the group's bound is then reported over whatever terms resolved
-- never silently zero, never a guess. An op this module has no MAC-bearing formula for (a residual
add, a window mean) gets no bound at all: fabricating one would be worse than omitting it.

A group's shape facts are first stated as a :class:`merlin.perf.schedule_proxy.Contraction`
(:func:`contraction_for`), so the bound above and the RANK signal beside it price the same work.
:func:`group_rank` is the validated schedule cost proxy's answer for that contraction -- array-tile
transactions of compute and movement, ordered against measured hardware -- reported beside the bound
and never folded into it: the proxy establishes an order between groups, not a cycle count.
