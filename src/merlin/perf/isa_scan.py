"""The custom-instruction scan of a large linked program, split by address over worker processes.

:func:`merlin.perf.isa_prohibition.custom_instructions` reads the disassembler's whole listing in one
interpreter loop: on SmolVLA's 640 MB open-model program that is 30 million lines and 9 million custom
instructions, one to two minutes of every build. The listing is a concatenation of function bodies, so
it splits exactly at function starts: each worker disassembles one contiguous address range with the
same disassembler (``--start-address``/``--stop-address`` at symbol boundaries, the first range open
below and the last open above) and parses it with the same rules, returning only what the check keeps
-- a count per (function, selector) in first-seen order and the first rows, in address order, of the
selectors asked for. :func:`merge` folds the ranges back in address order, so every count, every first-seen
order and every reported row is the one a single pass gives. Nothing here names a target.
