"""Per-group EFFICIENCY diagnostics: what a group's program issued, counted per execution, against its
derived roofline -- numbers that say WHAT is inefficient and never HOW to fix it.

    census = dynamic_census(elf, target=t, compiler=cc, group_objects={g: obj}, functional_model=spec, out=d)
    report = efficiency(census[g], roofline=bound, cycles=measured)

WHY DYNAMIC. A static census counts instruction WORDS in the code. A kernel that loops issues a word
once per trip, so the static count says nothing about how often anything ran: measured on one 1x1
group, 784 weight-load words in the code issued 3,136 times per invocation. Per-output-tile counts
from the static census would be fiction. So the census is static in what it DECODES -- each word's
role comes from the target's own ISA facts, by address, from the program's own disassembly -- and
dynamic in what it COUNTS: every address is weighted by how often the functional model executed it
(its PC histogram), divided by the invocations the program itself reports running.

WHAT IS COUNTED. Each accelerator instruction by its DERIVED ROLE (configuration, operand load, weight
load, accumulate, readout, sync), never by a name or an encoding, plus the host's memory-ordering
instruction, which on a co-processor stalls the host until the accelerator drains. That one is the
host ISA's, named by the disassembler that ships with the compiler (:data:`HOST_ORDERING_MNEMONIC`);
it is not a fact about any accelerator. Only code in the group's own kernel object is counted.

WHAT IS REPORTED (:func:`efficiency`): computes issued against the roofline's minimum, cycles per
compute, cycles against the roofline, and each role per OUTPUT TILE (the roofline's tile count). The
cycles are the measurement's; the census is the functional model's, which runs the same program bytes.
Nothing here names a target.
