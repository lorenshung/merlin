"""Was the operand movement placed where compute can hide it, or hoisted in front of the nest?

THE LEVER. A tiled contraction can stage its operands two ways. It can HOIST -- issue every transfer
the nest will need as one burst standing in front of the first compute -- or it can place each
transfer just before the position that first reads it, interleaved with the computes. Both emit the
same transfers to the same addresses; only the PLACEMENT differs. Measured on pinned elaborated RTL,
bit-exact against the vendor kernel in the same binary: -22.3% on 64x512x1024 and -12.7% on
64x256x1024 from moving the staging off the front of the nest and into it.

AND IT DOES NOT PAY EVERYWHERE, which is the fact that shapes this family and is the reason it is
NOT a demand made of every member. The same change measured -3.2% and -0.6% on two other shapes. The
two shapes it paid on are LOAD-critical -- the movement side is what the runtime is waiting for --
and the two it did nothing on are MESH-critical, where the array is. The discriminant that separates
those four points is the reload multiplicity (see :func:`merlin.perf.schedule_proxy._regime`), and it
is not a coincidence that it is also the OTHER lever's lever arm: on a mesh-critical shape the order
that keeps the array's operand resident stages a whole run of moving-operand windows together, so
demanding just-in-time placement there would fight the demand that actually pays. This family
therefore demands the property of load-critical members ONLY, waives it on mesh-critical ones, and
RECORDS the waiver -- see :mod:`merlin.perf.movein_claim`, which refuses a cohort carrying no waived
member, because a family that demanded this everywhere and a family that conditioned it on the
regime would otherwise be indistinguishable.

THE PROPERTY, and why this narrow form of it is the part that is PROVABLE:

    Movement issued while NO COMPUTE HAS YET ISSUED cannot be overlapped with compute. Not "is
    unlikely to be"; cannot -- there is no compute in flight to hide it behind, whatever the depth of
    the machine's load queue. Every transfer in that prefix beyond the ones the first compute
    position actually reads is work the runtime waits through before any useful cycle happens.

    Hence the demand: **the transfers issued before the first compute must not exceed what a
    declared number of compute positions consume**, that per-position need being read from the
    candidate's own stream (the producers of the operands the first compute and its stager read).

    The admitted depth is a DECLARED number in the family's frozen acceptance, not a constant here,
    and it is not a style preference: at one position there is no prefetch at all, so the contract
    declares the depth at which movement and compute can first be concurrent. A contract that
    declares none gets a REFUSAL, never a default.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DEMANDED, and the fact that is missing. The same argument does not extend
to a burst in the MIDDLE of the nest: there, computes are outstanding, and whether the movement
behind them is absorbed depends on how deep the load queue is. That depth is a real device property
-- the target this was measured on declares a load reservation window, and a burst deeper than it
fills the load side -- but it is NOT published in the extracted facts this repo reads. So it is
recorded as UNKNOWN and surfaced (``mid_stream_window`` in every verdict), the peak mid-stream run is
REPORTED beside the verdict as the lever arm, and nothing is failed on it. Guessing the window would
decide a performance verdict on a number nobody measured.

WHAT PASSING DOES NOT PROVE. Passing shows the nest does not stand a burst in front of itself. It is
not a speedup claim, it says nothing about the movement VOLUME (a nest that moves each tile twice
passes as long as it places both well), and -- because the provable part is the prefix -- a nest that
issues one compute and then bursts the rest passes. That last is reported, not hidden: the peak
mid-stream run travels with the verdict so a reader can see it.

FAIL CLOSED EVERYWHERE. The staging, compute and movement vocabularies come from the emitted ABI's
own def-use model, through the same resolution the stationary-residency family uses. A trace with no
compute, a first compute whose operands do not resolve, or a contract declaring no admitted depth
yields ``REFUSED`` with the reason -- never a pass, and never a substituted default.
