"""A cheap cost signal for an inner search loop: what a schedule ASKS THE DEVICE FOR.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
An agentic performance loop needs a number it can evaluate thousands of times. It has two
instruments and neither can do that job. The functional model is blind to timing -- it will report a
schedule that moves twice the bytes as free. Elaborated RTL and FireSim are timing-true and cost
minutes to hours per point. The gap between them is where the search actually lives, and it was
empty.

An UNVALIDATED proxy is worse than no proxy. Measured on this tree: a block-DMA change scored a 23%
WIN under the functional model and measured 2.8% to 12.8% WORSE on hardware. So every claim this
module makes is checked against measured hardware points, the check is a test
(``merlin/tests/dse/test_schedule_proxy.py``, over the measured points recorded with the target that
produced them), and the correlation it reaches is stated as a number rather than asserted as a property.
:mod:`merlin.perf.group_headroom` prices a model group through :func:`schedule_cost`, and the
``cost_proxy`` rung of ``merlin/contract/measurement_ladder.yaml`` names this module as its
implementation: a ranking signal, never a cycle count.

THE ONE FACT THAT SHAPES THE DESIGN
-----------------------------------
Bytes moved are PROVABLY insufficient on their own. :mod:`merlin.perf.mesh_occupancy` measured a
whole model's array issue count moving 21,383,000 -> 16,050,000 cycles -- a 25% swing -- with the
DRAM bytes per operand role BIT-IDENTICAL and the launch count unchanged. A proxy built on traffic
alone cannot see that, and a proxy that scores those two configurations equally is vacuous. So the
cost here is a PAIR: what the array is asked to issue, and what the movement engine is asked to
move. :func:`schedule_cost` never returns one without the other, and the test holds the pair.

THE UNIT, AND WHY THE TWO TERMS ARE COMMENSURATE
------------------------------------------------
Both terms are counted in ARRAY-TILE TRANSACTIONS -- one command's worth of work at the granularity
the array itself is built at (``array_rows x array_cols``). A compute transaction is one issued tile,
priced at one command slot plus the array occupancy that tile buys (a tile streaming a full
``array_rows`` is one slot's worth; a short one proportionally less -- no free weight). A movement
transaction is one tile's worth of bytes crossing the DRAM boundary. The two are commensurate because
on a sequenced accelerator they are entries in the SAME command stream, and that -- not a roofline
over two independent resources -- is why they are ADDED. Their relative price is the one calibrated
number in the model (:class:`Pricing`), it is never defaulted silently, and the neutral value 1.0 is
labelled uncalibrated where it is used.

MEASURED, against 71 FireSim-measured ResNet-50 compute groups (the explicit-nest arm of
``per_group_fsm_vs_explicit.json``, bitstreams ``0af6f26e`` / ``a9a190b9``, queue jobs 759/760/761;
per-group cycles span 18,885 to 3,250,325 and FSM-vs-explicit ratios span 1.13x to 5.30x):

=========================================  ==============  ====================
signal                                     Spearman rho    pairwise accuracy
=========================================  ==============  ====================
issue transactions alone                           0.878                 83.0%
movement bytes alone                               0.402                 62.9%
BOTH, uncalibrated (exchange rate 1.0)             0.920                 89.4%
BOTH, calibrated (exchange rate 3.5)               0.978                 93.2%
=========================================  ==============  ====================

That table is the argument for the design: neither term alone ranks, and the pair does. Pairwise
accuracy is the honest figure for a search loop -- how often the proxy picks the more expensive of
two candidates -- and it is why rank matters here more than absolute error, which stays large
(Pearson 0.884; median absolute relative error 43%, worst 105%, with the slot cost fitted on these
same points -- so this predicts an ORDER, not a cycle count, and must not be quoted as one).

The exchange rate is fitted, so it is checked for fitting noise rather than asserted: over 200
random half-splits the rate chosen on one half has median 3.5 (10th-90th percentile 3.0-6.0) and
scores median rho 0.970 (10th percentile 0.941) on the half it was not fitted on.

WHY THERE IS A REGIME VERDICT AND NOT ONLY A COST
--------------------------------------------------
A scalar cost is not enough, and that is measured rather than argued. On pinned elaborated RTL, nine
scheduling policies over four shapes found two levers that are ANTI-CORRELATED: a hoisted move-in
burst costs runtime only where the LOAD side is critical, and a stationary-operand reload costs
runtime only where the MESH is critical. Two shapes were load-limited (burst 13-22%, reload free) and
two were mesh-limited (reload 18-33%, burst free); **no shape was limited by both**. A proxy that
answers with one number averages two populations that never co-occur and is wrong in a different
direction on each half of a model.

So :attr:`ScheduleCost.regime` is a separate verdict, computed from the BLOCKING and needing no
simulator -- see :func:`_regime` for the four measured points and the discriminant they select. It is
:data:`UNDECIDED_REGIME` until a caller supplies the measured boundary, because the two regimes take
opposite optimisations and a guessed verdict aims the loop at the lever that is free.

:attr:`ScheduleCost.reload_pressure` and :attr:`~ScheduleCost.burst_pressure` are reported beside it
as the two levers' arms, so a caller sees how much each lever has to work with rather than only which
one to pull.

ONE LEVER IS REFUTED AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT REWARDED HERE. Hoisting the load-configuration state
measured -0.4% to +0.5% across every shape: a load config completes on issue, so paying one per
operand switch costs nothing. Nothing in this model gives it credit, and nothing should start to.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE -- the blind axis, named because naming it is what stops the next
23%-win-that-is-a-12%-loss
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Re-reads from capacity spills.** The movement term is the COMPULSORY footprint -- each tensor
   crossing the boundary once. A schedule that spills and re-reads moves more, and this under-prices
   it by exactly that factor. The tiling is derived anyway (:func:`~merlin.perf.derived_bound.select_tiling`)
   and :attr:`ScheduleCost.spill` NAMES the operands whose slab does not fit, so the risk is reported
   rather than silently priced at zero. It is not folded into the cost because, confronted with the
   71 points, charging the re-reads made the ranking WORSE (rho 0.937 -> 0.604 on the term as first
   formulated): on this device the
   schedules kept their slabs resident and the charge was fiction.
2. **Anything that is not a transaction count.** Bank conflicts, DRAM row locality, refresh, the
   host's own scalar code between launches, cache behaviour on the control processor, and dependence
   stalls inside the array are all invisible. Two schedules with the same transaction count score
   equal here and can differ on hardware for any of those reasons.
3. **Absolute cycles, unless the slot cost was measured.** Without a measured
   ``cycles_per_transaction`` the result carries ``cycles = UNKNOWN`` on purpose; the rank signal is
   still available, because the loop needs to pick the better of two candidates rather than predict a
   cycle count.
4. **Cross-device transfer.** The exchange rate, the slot cost and the regime boundary are properties
   of one device and one runtime. Carrying any of them to another device, or to the same device at
   another clock, is not licensed by anything here.
5. **Where the regime boundary actually sits.** Four measured shapes bound it to the open interval
   (4, 7] in reload multiplicity and no further, and one of them carries a ~7% per-arm noise floor
   from binary composition. A caller that supplies a boundary inside that interval is supported by
   the evidence; one that supplies a boundary outside it is not, and nothing here will say so.

Nothing in this module names a target, an opcode or a capacity: the geometry, the element widths and
the store capacities all arrive through :func:`~merlin.perf.derived_bound.machine_from_facts` from
the target's own RTL facts, and a term whose input is not evidenced is UNKNOWN with the reason
attached rather than defaulted.

    No shape was limited by both, and the lever that pays in one is free in the other -- which is why
    a single scalar cost is not enough: it averages two populations that never co-occur. Of the cheap
    discriminants available here, the reload multiplicity is the one that separates those four points
    (196 and 7 mesh-critical against 4 and 4 load-critical) AND is mechanistically the reload lever's
    own lever arm. The scalar compute/movement ratio does NOT separate them (3.96, 8.80 mesh against
    6.74, 6.10 load), so the regime is a separate verdict rather than a reading of the cost.

    Four points with a ~7% per-arm noise floor at the 7-row geometry bound the boundary to the open
    interval (4, 7] and no further, so the boundary is supplied as a measured device property and the
    verdict is UNDECIDED without one. A guessed boundary would point an optimisation loop at the
    wrong lever half the time, which is worse than pointing it at nothing.
