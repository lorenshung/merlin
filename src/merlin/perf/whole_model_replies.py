"""A compiler package's replies to a whole model's groups: recorded by content, asked in parallel.

Split out of :mod:`merlin.perf.whole_model_build` (which re-exports these names). A package is a
function of its own files and its input, so a reply recorded against both digests is what the package
would print again (:class:`_ReplyCache`). A model's statement asks one group at a time because each
splice binds against the buffers the previous ones declared; the ASKING does not depend on that, so
:class:`Asker` puts every group's interface to the package the moment the statement writes it, in
parallel, and -- when the target's object cache is on -- compiles each answered group's artifact to its
object in the same worker, so the slowest group's ask and compile start at once rather than after every
other group's. Nothing here names a target.
