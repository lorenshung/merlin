"""Decide a load-state residency family from the candidate's OWN emitted traces.

A family in this corpus has so far been decided from measured cycles -- a fitted law, or a paired
delta between two arms. Neither shape fits a demand on the COMPILER: a law measures the machine, and
a pair measures two emitter settings. Both are silent about whether today's candidate used the
mechanism, which is exactly the hole this family exists to close.

So this analyzer decides an ``EMITS`` claim: the evidence is the candidate's own instruction stream,
the property is
:func:`merlin.perf.load_state_residency.residency_verdict`'s, and the verdict is about the compiler
rather than about the target.

THE COHORT MUST BE ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE, and that is CHECKED rather than declared -- the discipline
``perf_paired_claim`` applies to its negative control, applied to the whole cohort. A demand whose
every member could be satisfied without the lever is a demand that cannot fail, which this repo has
shipped before (an epilogue the readout never applies; a relu whose clamp was unreachable). So:

* a member whose declared operands need MORE THAN ONE movement configuration is LEVER-BEARING: a
  program holding one configuration must re-establish them in turn, so the property is refutable on
  it;
* a member whose operands all share one configuration is a CONTROL: ONE held configuration suffices,
  so the member is passable without addressing a second state at all.

The control is not a member on which nothing can fail -- a program that reconfigures before every
transfer fails it too -- and claiming otherwise would be the overclaim this file is trying to avoid.
What it IS, exactly, is the member that the DEFECT THIS FAMILY NAMES passes: a nest holding a single
configuration re-establishes nothing here, because its one held configuration is the only one the
shape needs. That is what makes a lever-bearing failure attributable. If a control fails, the program
is redundant even where one configuration would do -- a different and broader defect -- and a
lever-bearing failure beside it cannot be attributed to the pitch alternation, so the cohort is
REFUSED rather than scored.

A cohort missing either kind is REFUSED. Not "passed with a note" -- refused, because the number it
would report is a number about nothing.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS NOT A BOUND. Which members are lever-bearing is read from the declared operand
shapes (the trailing extent of each operand the operation reads is its row pitch under this corpus's
row-major operand layout). It decides only which bucket a member lands in; the pass/fail arithmetic
comes entirely from the trace. So a mis-classification can weaken the cohort's discrimination
report -- which is visible -- but it can never manufacture a failure.
