"""A package's own MLIR passes over the whole-model interface, run before the builder splits it.

The whole-model statement (:mod:`merlin.llvmlower.whole_program`) turns a captured model into compute
GROUPS and puts each -- or, since :mod:`merlin.llvmlower.region_legality`, a legal run of them -- to
the package. Neither lets a package change what the MODEL ITSELF says before that split happens: a
package that would rather restate its own program (canonicalize a chain of casts, hoist a constant,
whatever transform it can prove preserves the function) has no way to ask for it. This module is that
way, and nothing more: it runs the package's OWN declared passes, over the package's OWN interpreter,
through the exact entrypoint mechanism every other package call already uses
(:func:`merlin.targetgen.oot_runner.run_entrypoint`) -- never by importing or executing package code
in this process.

**Declaration is data, not code.** A package's ``manifest.yaml`` may carry a top-level
``whole_model_passes: [name, ...]`` list; each name must also be one of its own declared ``commands``
(the same manifest section every entrypoint already comes from), run in the ORDER the list gives, each
one's own declared ``argv`` invoked exactly like any other entrypoint (``{tool}``/``{input_mlir}``/
``{output_json}``) with the previous stage's output as the next stage's input. Nothing here executes a
name the manifest omits, and nothing here decides what a pass may compute: verifying that a pass did
not change the model's own function is a SEPARATE, independent check
(:func:`merlin.perf.whole_model_build.verify_passes_preserve_semantics`), because deciding whether to
trust a transform is not this module's job -- running the ones asked for, in order, and recording
exactly what happened, is.

**Fails closed, one pass at a time.** A pass that cannot even be invoked, or whose own reply is not
parseable MLIR text, stops the chain right there: the caller gets back the LAST module every prior
pass in the chain actually produced (the original, if the very first pass failed), together with a
per-pass record naming which ones ran and which one stopped it. A caller that skipped this and used
whatever text happened to be on disk would silently grade one package's chosen edits and call it every
other package's default behavior.
