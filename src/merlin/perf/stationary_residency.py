"""Did the emitted nest KEEP the operand the array holds, or shift it back in on every compute?

THE LEVER, and the measurement that makes it the biggest single item in the gap. On a target whose
compute array retains one operand across commands, a staging command either NAMES a block -- which
shifts that block through the array before any useful work issues -- or names the ABI's retain
sentinel, which keeps what the array already holds. A tiled nest whose inner loops vary only the
accumulator tile and the moving operand's window presents the SAME block to the array for a whole
run of consecutive positions. Naming it on every one of them shifts identical bytes in, over and
over, for nothing.

Measured on pinned elaborated RTL, bit-exact against the vendor kernel in the same binary: peeling
the first position of each run as the one naming command and retaining for the rest moved one
shape's execute-controller busy count from 97,301 to 51,657 (-24.6%), and -17.8% / -19.8% at a
7-row output geometry. The saving tracks the run length exactly (-16.5% at depth 7, -7..-8% at depth
8-16, ~0 at depth 2 -- where there is almost nothing to remove).

THE INSTRUCTION COUNT DOES NOT CHANGE, and that is the whole reason this has to be a demand on a
PROPERTY rather than on a count. This ABI takes a compute's destination from the staging command
before it, so one staging command per compute is the floor either way. What changes is which of them
NAME a block. A demand written as "issue fewer staging commands" would be unsatisfiable; a demand
written as "do not re-establish what the array already holds" is exactly the lever, and is the same
sentence :mod:`merlin.perf.load_state_residency` makes about the load path's configuration state.

TWO FLOORS, AND WHY ONE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. The identity of a held tile is the OFF-CHIP
SOURCE its bytes were moved in from, not the staging slot it occupies -- a schedule that recycles one
slot between two positions is exactly the schedule this family is about, and identifying by slot
would let the defect rename itself out of view. On that identity two floors are computable from the
candidate's own stream:

``runs`` -- the number of maximal runs of consecutive positions presenting distinct tiles.
    The array holds exactly one tile: whatever the last naming command shifted in. A command naming
    the tile the array ALREADY HOLDS establishes state already established and is provably inert,
    whatever the nest's loop order. This floor needs no admission and no reordering.

``distinct`` -- the number of distinct tiles presented anywhere in the program.
    The weaker floor alone is DODGEABLE, and the dodge is not hypothetical: a nest ordered so that a
    different block lands at every position has no consecutive repeats at all, passes the run-length
    demand outright, and pays the identical shift-in cost -- a demand that cannot fail. So where the
    reuse-ordered nest is admissible, the floor is the distinct count, which no loop order dodges.

ADMISSION IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED. The order that presents each tile once holds one output column
strip resident across the whole reduction, so a machine whose accumulator cannot hold what the
program commits has to drain and re-present, and no reordering removes it. The bound is the target's
own accumulator depth over its own array row count -- both extracted from its RTL. When the program's
committed output exceeds it, this REFUSES the stronger floor and demands only the run-length one,
saying so in the verdict, rather than failing a compiler for not doing something the machine forbids.

WHAT ELSE MAKES THE EXCESS AVOIDABLE, also derived. Retaining is only expressible where the ABI has a
retain form: a sentinel the staging command accepts in place of a block address, and more than one
compute class inheriting from that stager -- the "use what was just shifted in" form and the "keep
computing against what is resident" form. Both are read from the emitted ABI's own def-use model. An
ABI declaring one compute class per stager has no retain form, every naming command is compulsory,
and this family REFUSES rather than failing a compiler for lacking a mechanism its ABI does not have.

WHAT PASSING DOES NOT PROVE. Passing shows the redundant shift-in work is ABSENT. It is not a speedup
claim, and it is silent about the movement side: a nest that re-reads the same tile from memory
before presenting it again is counted as presenting one tile here and is a different defect, for the
movement-placement family to name. It is also silent about correctness -- whether a retained position
PAIRS its retain sentinel with the compute form that consumes resident state is the numeric oracle's
business, not this property's, and a candidate getting that wrong fails the oracle, not this check.

FAIL CLOSED EVERYWHERE. The staging and compute vocabularies come from the emitted ABI's own def-use
model; the retain sentinel from the selected support's ABI
(:func:`merlin.targetgen.rocc.decode.retain_sentinel`); the accumulator bound from the target's
extracted memories and array geometry. A naming command whose bytes have no observed producer, or a
producer whose off-chip operand does not resolve, yields ``REFUSED`` with the reason -- never a pass,
and never a substituted default.
