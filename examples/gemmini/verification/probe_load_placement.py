"""What load states, move-in placement, readout placement and weight reuse are worth to an open-coded nest.

This is a target-local measurement probe, not a compiler test. It builds ONE bare-metal binary carrying the
same contraction under several scheduling policies, runs it on a selected RTL engine and reads the unit's own
performance counters. The findings it produced, and the hardware revision they belong to, are recorded in
`docs/design/open_coded_nest_costs.md`.

An open-coded (sequencer-free) contraction has to configure the load unit before every move-in whose
DRAM row pitch differs from the last one configured. A backend that uses ONE configuration state must
therefore re-issue that configuration every time it switches operand -- the stationary operand, the
moving operand and the bias seed have three different pitches -- and, more consequentially, it can
only ever emit the move-ins of one operand in an uninterrupted burst, because interleaving them would
cost a configuration instruction between every pair.

The unit has more than one such state. How many is a property of the RTL, read here from the target's
own ISA header (the move-in opcodes it defines) rather than assumed, and the configuration instruction
names which state it writes. Giving each operand its own state makes the per-block reconfiguration
disappear AND lifts the ordering constraint, so the two effects are measured apart:

    ld1_hoist   one state, per-block reconfiguration, operands moved in in bursts   (the baseline)
    ld3_hoist   one state per operand, configured once, same burst order            (- the config cost)
    ld3_jit     one state per operand, each tile moved in just before its first use  (+ the reordering)
    ld1_jit     one state, just-in-time order, paying a reconfiguration per move-in  (the control that
                shows the states are what makes the reordering affordable)

`loop_ws` -- the hardware loop sequencer -- is measured alongside as the correctness oracle every arm
is compared against element for element. It is NOT the thing being optimised: a result that routes
through the sequencer measures the hardware's tiling choice, not a compiler's schedule.

Arms live in ONE bare-metal binary and are compared only against each other inside it, because an
arm's measured cycles move with how many output buffers its neighbours in the same binary declared.
